# On sight:

- Concept of which lines are on screen. Would allow:
    - Setting right scroll limit relative to the longest line on screen.
    - Render only visible lines.
- Fix background.

- Clean-up my types.
- Cursor.
- Editing.


# Non-pressing:

- Fixed framerate.
- Hot reload.
- Line numbers?
- Resizeability.


# Potential niceties:

- Draw calls only for text that fits on screen?
- Single draw call?
- Double buffering?
