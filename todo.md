- Refactor time stuff into procs.
- Move procs in main to other files.

# Non-pressing:

- Hot reload.
- Line numbers.
- Resizeability.

- (Cursor) Jump tabs by tabstop increments (careful not to do so with spaces).
- Rethink margins. Inner margin (within text area) and outside margin?
- Setting right scroll limit relative to the longest line on screen.
- Background right limit.

- Double buffering
- Single draw call?

- Create UI library?

- Rethink Input config system.

- File, function and section pins and traversal.

- Different cursor-view model (view follows cursor but cursor doesn't follow view.)

- Info bar:
    - filename.
    - Error number.

- Multiple panels.

- Performance profiler.
